## vuln_scan_xml

### Breakdown of XML Elements
This XML file captures the results of a security assessment.

**vuln elements**: Each entry represents a detected vulnerability, containing attributes such as:
1. **id**: A unique identifier for the vulnerability.
2. **name**: The title of the vulnerability (e.g., "Traceroute", "Hostname Determination Reporting").
3. **type**: The vulnerability type, typically listed as nvt (Network Vulnerability Test).
4. **creation_time & modification_time**: Timestamps indicating when the vulnerability was first recorded and last updated.
5. **severity**: Indicates the risk level of the vulnerability (e.g., 0.0 suggests it’s informational rather than critical).
6. **qod (Quality of Detection)**: Reflects the confidence score of detection (e.g., 80%).

**results**: Contains scan-related data such as:
-count: How many times the vulnerability was detected.
-oldest & newest: The date/time range during which detections occurred.
-hosts: The number of affected hosts.

**filters element**: Specifies criteria used to refine the displayed vulnerabilities:
-min_qod=70: Only includes findings with at least 70% detection confidence.
-sort-reverse=severity: Sorts the list by severity in descending order.
-rows=10: Limits the output to 10 entries.
-severity=0: Filters for vulnerabilities with a severity rating of 0.0.

**sort element**: Defines the sorting method (based on severity).

**vulns attributes (start=1 max=10)**: Specifies pagination, showing 10 vulnerabilities per page starting from the first.

**vuln_count element**: Displays the total number of vulnerabilities, how many match the filters, and pagination details.

### Key Components

**General Information**
- **Status**: `200 OK` — Indicates the scan results were retrieved successfully.
- **Task Name**: `"Full Scan"` — Describes the overall scope of the performed scan.
- **Host IP**: `192.168.2.123`
- **Ports Scanned**: Various general ports including `general/tcp`, `general/CPE-T`.

**Detected Test Results (NVT - Network Vulnerability Tests)**

- **CPE Inventory (CPE-T)**  
  - Gathers Common Platform Enumeration (CPE) data for detected OS, services, and applications.
  - **Identified OS**: Linux Kernel (`cpe:/o:linux:kernel`)
  - **Detection Accuracy (QoD)**: 80%

- **Hostname Determination Reporting**  
  - Confirms how the hostname of the target was resolved.
  - **Method**: IP-address mapping.

- **OS Detection Consolidation and Reporting**  
  - Aggregates OS detection information from multiple sources.
  - **Conclusion**: Host is running the Linux Kernel (identified via ICMP fingerprinting).

- **Traceroute**  
  - Assesses the route and hop count between the scanner and target.
  - **Network Distance**: 1 hop — Indicates a direct connection to the target.

Additional Metadata
- **Severity**: `0.0` — Informational only; no actual security threat identified.
- **CVSS Base Vector**: `AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:N` — Confirms that the findings do not represent a security vulnerability.
- **Tags**: Provide context on how data was gathered during the scan.

Summary

This XML scan report primarily documents host identification, operating system detection, and network path analysis. No critical vulnerabilities were found, as all entries are marked with a severity of `0.0`. These insights are valuable for understanding system configurations and verifying network connectivity, even in the absence of immediate threats.
